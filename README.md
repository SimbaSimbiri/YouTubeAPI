Submitted by: **Ray Isaac Simbiri**

Time spent: **2** hours spent in total

## Summary

**YoutubeAPI** is an android app that **that displays a scrollable list of thumbnails from the YouTubeDataAPI V3")**

If I had to describe this project in three (3) emojis, they would be: **üòÄüéâüëç**

## Application Features


The following REQUIRED features are completed:

- [x] Make an API call to an API of your choice using AsyncHTTPClient
- [x] Implement a RecyclerView to display a list of entries from the API
- [x] Display at least three (3) pieces of data for each RecyclerView item

The following STRETCH features are implemented:

- [ ] Add a UI element for the user to interact with API further
- [ ] Show a `Toast` or `Snackbar` when an item is clicked
- [ ] Add item dividers with `DividerItemDecoration`

The following EXTRA features are implemented:

- [x] I implemented a runnable that is implemented automatically after five seconds by the root decor view of my activity. User doesn't need a button to fetch data.
